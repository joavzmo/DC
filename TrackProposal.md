**_Note_**: *the track is composed of six existing courses (1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8) and two newly proposed courses (5, 6). See [TaskAnalysis](TaskAnalysis.md) for the rationale behind it. For the existing courses, the marketing description and prerequisites are copied from the course website. The learning objectives, however, are adapted from the course details.*

# Skill Track: Deep Learning in Python

Deep learning is having a tremendous success in artificial intelligence, from speech recognition to drug design. Learn its fundamental concepts and start building deep neural networks with state-of-the-art libraries.

## 1 - [Deep Learning in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/deep-learning-in-python)
"Deep learning is the machine learning technique behind the most exciting capabilities in diverse areas like robotics, natural language processing, image recognition and artificial intelligence (including the famous AlphaGo). In this course, you'll gain hands-on, practical knowledge of how to use deep learning with Keras 2.0, the latest version of a cutting edge library for deep learning in Python."
  * Learning objectives
    * Learner will be able to understand the fundamental concepts and terminology used in deep learning. 
    * Learner will be able to create neural networks with the Specify-Compile-Fit-Optimize-Validate Keras workflow.
  * Prerequisites
    * [Introduction to Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science)
    * [Intermediate Python for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-python-for-data-science)
    * [Supervised Learning with scikit-learn](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/supervised-learning-with-scikit-learn)

## 2 - [Deep Learning with Keras in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/deep-learning-with-keras-in-python)
**_Note_**: *This course has substantial overlap with 1, which, in my opinion, has much higher quality. I would discuss with my manager the possibility of dropping this course from the track.*

"Deep learning is here to stay! It's the go-to technique to solve complex problems that arise with unstructured data and an incredible tool for innovation. Keras is one of the frameworks that make it easier to start developing deep learning models, and it's versatile enough to build industry-ready models in no time. In this course, you will learn regression and save the earth by predicting asteroid trajectories, apply binary classification to distinguish between real and fake dollar bills, use multiclass classification to decide who threw which dart at a dart board, learn to use neural networks to reconstruct noisy images and much more. Additionally, you will learn how to better control your models during training and how to tune them to boost their performance."

  * Learning objectives
    * Learner will be able to interpret more advanced neural network metrics and architectures
    * Learner will be able to select more adequate parameters for building and validating a neural network.
