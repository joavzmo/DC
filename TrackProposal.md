# Skill Track: Deep Learning in Python

Deep learning is having a tremendous success in artificial intelligence, from speech recognition to drug design. Learn the fundamental concepts and start building deep neural networks with state-of-the-art libraries.

*Note*: the track is composed of 6 existing courses and 2 newly proposed courses. See [TaskAnalysis](TaskAnalysis.md) for the motivation.
