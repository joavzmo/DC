# Task Analysis

This document explains the rationale behind the curriculum design of the **Deep Learning in Python** track and lists the main used references.

## Track specifications 

The new track must: 
  * **Provide marketable skills from day 1**: it must expose the learner to the main current deep learning tools in Python (Keras, PyTorch and TensorFlow).
  * **Be in line with the DataCamp philosophy**: it must be interesting and accessible to wide audiences, progressively building advanced knowledge from simple concepts, without getting lost in the mathematical details.
  * **Be easy to implement**: from a business perspective, including relevant *existing* courses should be favored, avoiding substantial overlap between them.

## Analysis of the DataCamp's portfolio

These are current courses that are directly relevant to the track:

  * [Deep Learning in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/deep-learning-in-python)
  * [Deep Learning with Keras in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/deep-learning-with-keras-in-python) (Live since June 28)
  * [Advanced Deep Learning with Keras in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/advanced-deep-learning-with-keras-in-python) (Live since June 24)
  * [Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Processing](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/convolutional-neural-networks-for-image-processing)
  * [Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/deep-learning-with-pytorch)
  * [Introduction to TensorFlow in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-tensorflow-in-python)

According to [DataCamp's roadmap](https://trello.com/b/BLplifUB/datacamp-course-roadmap), these are "in development" courses whose contents I would like to check in more detail:

  * Recurrent Neural Networks for Language Modeling in Python by David Cecchini
  * Spoken Language Processing in Python by Daniel Bourke

## Analysis of the competitor's portfolio

There are plenty of Deep Learning online courses available. Some of our most relevant competitors are:

  * **Coursera**: Deep Learning Specialization
  * **edX**: IBM's Deep Learning
  * **Udemy**: Deep Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Artificial Neural Networks

## Annotated bibliography
  * François Chollet, *Deep Learning with Python*. Manning Publications, 2018
    * Hands-on reference written by the creator of Keras, perfect for educated beginners.
  * Ian Goodfellow et al, *Deep Learning*. MIT Press, 2016
    * A bible in the field, more adequate for researchers, available [here](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
  * Andrew W. Trask, *Grokking Deep Learning*. Manning Publications, 2019
    * Very easy to read, recent reference.
