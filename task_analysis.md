# Task analysis

This document explains the rationale behind the curriculum design of the Deep Learning in Python track.

## Deep learning track rationale 

The new track must be: 
..* Useful from day 1: it must expose the learner to the main current deep learning tools in Python: Keras, PyTorch and TensorFlow.
..* Coherent with the DataCamp philosophy: it must be interesting and accessible to wide audiences, and build advanced knowledge from simple concepts.
..* Efficient: it should include as many relevant existing courses as possible, avoiding substantial overlap.

## DataCamp portfolio

Current courses that are directly relevant to the track:

..* Deep Learning in Python
..* Deep Learning with Keras in Python
..* Advanced Deep Learning with Keras in Python
..* Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Processing
..* Deep Learning with PyTorch
..* Introduction to TensorFlow in Python
