# Task analysis

This document explains the rationale behind the curriculum design of the Deep Learning in Python track.

## Deep learning track rationale 

The new track must be: 
  * Useful from day 1: it must expose the learner to the main current deep learning tools in Python: Keras, PyTorch and TensorFlow.
  * Coherent with the DataCamp philosophy: it must be interesting and accessible to wide audiences, and build advanced knowledge from simple concepts.
  * Efficient: it should include as many relevant existing courses as possible, avoiding substantial overlap.

## DataCamp portfolio

Current courses that are directly relevant to the track:

  * Deep Learning in Python
  * Deep Learning with Keras in Python
  * Advanced Deep Learning with Keras in Python
  * Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Processing
  * Deep Learning with PyTorch
  * Introduction to TensorFlow in Python

## Competitor's portfolio

There are plenty of Deep Learning online courses available. Some of the most relevant competitors are:

  * Coursera: Deep Learning Specialization
  * edX: IBM's Deep Learning
  * Udemy: Deep Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Artificial Neural Networks
