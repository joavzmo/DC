# Task analysis

This document explains the rationale behind the curriculum design of the Deep Learning in Python track.

## Deep learning track rationale 

The new track must be: 
  * Useful from day 1: it must expose the learner to the main current deep learning tools in Python: Keras, PyTorch and TensorFlow.
  * Coherent with the DataCamp philosophy: it must be interesting and accessible to wide audiences, and build advanced knowledge from simple concepts.
  * Efficient: it should include as many relevant existing courses as possible, avoiding substantial overlap.

## DataCamp portfolio

These are current courses that are directly relevant to the track:

  * [Deep Learning in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/deep-learning-in-python)
  * [Deep Learning with Keras in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/deep-learning-with-keras-in-python) (Live since June 28)
  * [Advanced Deep Learning with Keras in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/advanced-deep-learning-with-keras-in-python) (Live since June 24)
  * [Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Processing](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/convolutional-neural-networks-for-image-processing)
  * [Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/deep-learning-with-pytorch)
  * [Introduction to TensorFlow in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-tensorflow-in-python)

According to your [roadmap](https://trello.com/b/BLplifUB/datacamp-course-roadmap), these are "in development" courses whose contents I would like to check in more detail:

  * Recurrent Neural Networks for Language Modeling in Python by David Cecchini
  * Spoken Language Processing in Python by Daniel Bourke

## Competitor's portfolio

There are plenty of Deep Learning online courses available. Some of the most relevant competitors are:

  * Coursera: Deep Learning Specialization
  * edX: IBM's Deep Learning
  * Udemy: Deep Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Artificial Neural Networks

## Annotated bibliography
  * François Chollet, Deep Learning with Python, Manning Publications, 2018
    * Hands-on reference written by the creator of Keras, perfect for educated beginners.
  * Ian Goodfellow et al, Deep Learning, MIT Press, 2016
    * A bible in the field, more adequate for researchers.
  * Andrew W. Trask, Grokking Deep Learning, Manning Publications, 2019
    * Very easy to read, recent reference.
  * Andrew Ng & Kian Katanforoosh, CS230 Deep Learning (Spring 2019), Stanford University, http://cs230.stanford.edu/
    * By the authors of the coursera specialization, with the advantage of having all the materials available in the course website.
