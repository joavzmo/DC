# Task analysis

This document explains the rationale behind the Deep Learning in Python track curriculum design.

## Deep learning track rationale 

The new curriculum must be: 
..* Useful from day 1: it must expose the learner to the main current deep learning tools in Python: Keras, PyTorch and TensorFlow.
..* Coherent with the DataCamp philosophy: it must be interesting and accessible to wide audiences, and build advanced knowledge from simple concepts.
..* Efficient: it should include as many relevant existing courses as possible, avoiding substantial overlap.
