# Value proposition: Research Funded Projects

## Interest for DataCamp
  * Attract public funding.
  * Develop courses in very advanced topics.
  * Gain visibility and prestige among top players in the statistics sector.
  
  
## Motivation
  * I have experience in European grant applications, from grant preparation to project management and reporting.
  * EU grants are extremely competitive, but provide very generous funds during several years.
  * There is usually a partner in charge of a "Dissemination" work package. In my experience, the reach and impact of the dissemination actions is limited
