# Value proposition: Research Funded Projects

## Interest for DataCamp
  * Attract public funding.
  * Develop courses in very advanced topics.
  * Gain visibility and prestige among top players in the statistics sector.
  
## Motivation
  * I have experience in European grant applications, from grant preparation to project management and reporting.
  * EU grants are extremely competitive, but provide very generous funds during several years. The next funding framework, Horizon Europe, will be launched in 2021 with increased funds (100bn)
  * There is usually a partner in charge of a "Dissemination" work package. In my experience, the reach and impact of the dissemination actions is limited, partly becasue of the will to protect business secrets.
  * DataCamp is a natural partner for this Dissemination work package. It has the infrastructure, the interest and the reach.
  * DataCamp could join strong consortiums in statistical research and be in charge of creating advanced statistics courses to disseminate the research results.
  * These courses would have a reduced target audience, but their development would come at no financial cost for DataCamp.
  * Being part of successful consortiums and having such courses in the portfolio bring marketing and partnership opportunities.  
  
## Action plan
  * Identify strong consortiums in the field of statistical research.
  * Nurture the relationship with the academic institutions leading those consortiums, express our determination to contribute and convince them of our added value.
  * Join their next grant preparations and become an active partner.
  * TImeframe: it will take a few years to get the first grant, but once the process and relationships are established, we can expect a continuous income from
